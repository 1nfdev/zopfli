Zopfli Compression Algorithm is a compression library programmed in C to perform
very good, but slow, deflate or zlib compression.

gzip.c is separate from the library and contains an example program to create
very well compressed gzip files.

The basic function to compress data is Deflate in deflate.h. Use the Options
object to set parameters that affect the speed and compression. Use the
InitOptions function to place the default values in the Options first.

This function creates a valid deflate stream. To get a valid zlib stream
instead, you need to add a small zlib header and a checksum around this stream
yourself. Please see the Zlib specification for more details:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt.

This library can only compress, not decompress. Existing zlib or deflate
libraries can decompress the data.

Zopfli Compression Algorithm was created by Lode Vandevenne and Jyrki
Alakuijala, based on an algorithm by Jyrki Alakuijala.
